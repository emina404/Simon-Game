# Simon-Game

The Simon Game starts by generating a random sequence of colors such as red, green, yellow, or blue. The player's objective is to memorize this sequence displayed through buttons and then replicate it in the correct order.

The game comprises four buttons with predefined styles in CSS. An event listener is used to detect button presses and trigger corresponding actions. jQuery is employed for frontend interaction, simplifying DOM manipulation, event handling, and button animations. Additionally, distinct sounds are played upon each button press, varying based on whether the response is accurate or not.
